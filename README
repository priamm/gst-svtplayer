This will perhaps be a usable player for SVT Play (Swedish Television). It depends on whether I get bored or run into huge problems.

Planned main features:
* Based on Gstreamer (compiled with Android NDK)
* Fast downloading of streams for offline use
* Live streaming of the (adaptive) hires Apple HTTP streams instead of lowres RTSP/RTP
* Avoid using the buffering in OpenCore since it sucks

We'll see what will come of it.
